# LLMImageIndexer

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

LLMImageIndexer is an intelligent image processing and indexing tool that leverages local AI to generate comprehensive metadata for your image collection. This tool uses advanced language models to analyze images and generate captions and keyword metadata.

## Features
 
- **Intelligent Image Analysis**: Utilizes a local AI model to generate a variable number of keywords and a caption for each image.
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Can automatically edit image metadata with generated tags.
- **Local Processing**: All processing is done locally on your machine.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles a wide range of image formats, including all major raw camera files.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Includes a GUI and installer. Relies on Koboldcpp, a single executable, for all AI functionality.  
- **GPU Acceleration**: Will use Apple Metal, Nvidia CUDA, or AMD (Vulkan) hardware if available to greatly speed inference.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, macOS ARM, and Linux.
- **Stop and Start Capability**: Can stop and start without having to reprocess all the files again.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- KoboldCPP

### Windows Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/jabberjabberjabber/LLavaImageTagger/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

2. Install [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

3. Download [KoboldCPP.exe](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases) and place it in the LlavaImageTagger folder. If it is not named KoboldCPP.exe, rename it to KoboldCPP.exe

4. Run `llmii-run.bat` and wait exiftool to install. When it is complete you must start the file again. If you called it from a terminal window you will need to close the windows and reopen it. It will then create a python environment and download the model weights. The download is quite large (6GB) and there is no progress bar, but it only needs to do this once. Once it is done KoboldCPP will start and one of the terminal windows will say ```Please connect to custom endpoint at http://localhost:5001``` and then it is ready.

### macOS Installation (including ARM)

1. Clone the repository or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/jabberjabberjabber/LLavaImageTagger/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

2. Install Python 3.7 or higher if not already installed. You can use Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install python
   ```

3. Install ExifTool:
   ```
   brew install exiftool
   ```

4. Download [KoboldCPP for macOS](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases) and place it in the LLMImageIndexer folder.

5. Open a terminal in the LLMImageIndexer folder and run:
   ```
   chmod +x koboldcpp-mac-arm64
   ./llmii-run.sh
   ```

### Linux Installation

1. Clone the repository or download and extract the ZIP file.

2. Install Python 3.7 or higher if not already installed. Use your distribution's package manager, for example on Ubuntu:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
   ```

3. Install ExifTool. On Ubuntu:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
   ```

4. Download the appropriate KoboldCPP binary for your Linux distribution from [KoboldCPP releases](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases) and place it in the LLMImageIndexer folder.

5. Open a terminal in the LLMImageIndexer folder and run:
   ```
   chmod +x koboldcpp-linux-x64
   ./llmii-run.sh
   ```

For all platforms, the script will set up the Python environment, install dependencies, and download necessary model weights (6GB total). This initial setup is performed only once and will take a few minutes depending on your download speed.

## Usage

1. Ensure KoboldCPP is running. Wait until you see the following message in the KoboldCPP window:
   ```
   Please connect to custom endpoint at http://localhost:5001
   ```

2. Launch the LLMImageIndexer GUI:
   - On Windows: Run `llmii-run.bat`
   - On macOS/Linux: Run `python3 llmii-gui.py`

3. Configure the indexing settings in the GUI:
   - Select the target image directory
   - Set the API URL (default: http://localhost:5001)
   - Choose metadata tags to generate (keywords, descriptions)
   - Set additional options (crawl subdirectories, backup files, etc.)

4. Click "Run Image Indexer" to start the process.

5. Monitor the progress in the output area of the GUI.

## Configuration Options

- **Directory**: Target image directory (includes subdirectories by default)
- **API URL**: KoboldCPP API endpoint (change if running on another machine)
- **API Password**: Set if required by your KoboldCPP setup
- **Reprocess failed**: If any files failed in the last round, it will try to process them again
- **Reprocess ALL**: The files that are processed already are stored in a database and skipped if you resume later, this will do them all over again
- **Don't crawl subdirectories**: Disable scanning of subdirectories
- **Don't make backups before writing**: Skip creating backup files
- **Pretend mode**: Simulate processing without writing to files or database
- **Keywords**: Choose to clear and write new keywords or update existing ones
